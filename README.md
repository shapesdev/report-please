# Report_Please

**About the project

A simple 2D puzzle game, which is mostly a copy-cat of the famous puzzle game "Papers, Please". In this game instead of focusing on the people entering the borders as in the original game. In this game the main focus is to prepare testers to clearly see faulty reports and decide whether they were filed correctly or not. The mechanics are the same as in the original game. The game was made following the MVC model and using two commonly known design patterns, which are Singleton and Observer. The game uses PlayFab to keeping the data for the game, the same data can be exported to a Excel file after finishing all the levels. Making this game, writing clean and extendable code was a key point and making sure the code would follow the DRY principle.
